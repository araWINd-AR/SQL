You’re getting that output because **Markdown rules are being broken** — long sentences are on the same line, so GitHub renders them as a single paragraph.
This is not your fault; it’s how Markdown works.

Below is the **BEST, cleanest, professional way** to write this README so that:

* Text is readable
* Sections are clearly separated
* GitHub renders it properly
* It still feels **human-written**, not robotic

👉 **Delete everything in your README.md and paste ONLY this exactly as-is**.

# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my SQL practice files created while learning and strengthening database concepts.

It is organized topic-wise so that each file focuses on a specific SQL concept, making it easy to revise, practice, and understand.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a clear record of my SQL learning journey through hands-on examples rather than just theory.

---

## What This Repository Contains

This repository covers most of the fundamental and intermediate SQL topics, including:

* Creating databases and tables
* Inserting data into tables
* Writing SELECT queries
* Using logical operators such as AND, OR, and IN
* Working with joins
* Applying aggregate functions
* Grouping data using GROUP BY and filtering with HAVING
* Using constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys
* Updating and deleting records
* Creating and using views
* Understanding ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE commands

---

* Basic create database.sql – Database and table creation basics
* CREATION_INSERTION_QUERIES.sql – Creating tables and inserting data
* Joins.sql – Join operations between tables

### Why this works (important)

* `-` creates clean lists
* Two spaces at the end of a line force proper line breaks
* Headings use `#` and `##` correctly
* GitHub will **not merge lines anymore**

This is **portfolio-ready** and **academically clean**.

If you want, next I can:

* Make a **minimal one-page README**
* Make a **resume-focused GitHub README**
* Add a **Learning Progress** section
* Add **future improvements** section

Just tell me what level you want.
