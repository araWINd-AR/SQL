SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my SQL practice files created while learning and strengthening database concepts.
It is organized topic-wise so that each file focuses on a specific SQL concept, making it easy to revise, practice, and understand.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a clear record of my SQL learning journey through hands-on examples rather than just theory.
